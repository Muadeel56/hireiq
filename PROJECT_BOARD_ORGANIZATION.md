# 📋 Project Board Organization Guide

## 🎯 Current Status

Your project board now has all 25 issues, but they're all in the "No Status" column. Here's how to organize them properly:

## 🚀 How to Organize Your Project Board

### Step 1: Visit Your Project Board
Go to: **https://github.com/users/Muadeel56/projects/5**

- 🎨 **Initialize React 19 Frontend with Tailwind CSS v4** (#2)
- 🔐 **Implement User Authentication System** (#3)
- 👤 **Create User Profile Management** (#4)
- 📱 **Responsive UI/UX Design System** (#5)

#### **In Progress Column** (Active Work)
Move issues you're currently working on here.

#### **Done Column** (Completed)
Move completed issues here.

### Step 3: Drag and Drop Process

1. **Click and drag** each issue from "No Status" column
2. **Drop it** into the appropriate column (Todo, In Progress, or Done)
